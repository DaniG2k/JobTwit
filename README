In Detail
############

JobTwit uses urllib and json to intelligently run queries on Twitter.

On the main screen, you are presented with three options:

1) View the general statistics
2) Query Twitter for a particlar programming language
3) Query Twitter for the most popular programming language

Number 1 will get a list of Tweets and list the languages by job postings and popularity.

Number 2 will prompt the user for a particular programming language. It will then ask the user if he/she would like
to specify a geolocation. It subsequently runs the query on Twitter and finds all the tweets that match the query.
The user can then decide whether to learn more about the collected urls that are within those tweets by crawling
each page. The pages are scanned one by one and the url as well as the page's title are returned.

Number 3 is a combination of number 1 and number 2. The most popular programming language is first established,
then passed as a parameter to the function that makes you look at the tweets more in depth (along with the urls
they point to)

Note:
If you change the 'pages' variable in the getTweets method, the program will scan more Twitter results. Allowed
values are 1-15.
