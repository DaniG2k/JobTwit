This is JobTwit. It's awesome. It will find you a job.

JobTwit does the following:
1) Prompts the user to select a programming language
2) Asks if a geo-location should be specified
3) Retrieves the Tweets and displays them

Optionally, the user can then choose to:
1) See EVERY url that was listed in those Tweets
2) Read the title of the page the url referes to
3) If the title catches your attention, there ya go! JobTwit just found your dream job :)
